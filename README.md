# 🔄 Bubble Sort and Swaps README 🔄

Welcome to the Bubble Sort and Swaps script! This Python script performs bubble sorting on an array of integers and counts the number of swaps required to sort it. Below, you'll find the script and instructions on how to use it.

# 📜 Description:

The Bubble Sort and Swaps script performs the bubble sort algorithm on an array of integers and calculates the number of swaps needed to sort the array. It then displays the results, including the number of swaps made, the first element after sorting, and the last element after sorting.

# 🚀 How to Use:

1. Open the script in your preferred Python environment.

2. Replace the input method or provide an appropriate array size and elements to the 'n' and 'a' variables, respectively.

3. Run the script.

4. The script will output the number of swaps, the first sorted element, and the last sorted element.

# 🛠️ Customization:

You can customize the script to work with different input types or adapt it for specific use cases.
